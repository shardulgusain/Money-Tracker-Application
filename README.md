# Money Tracker Application

A simple budget tracking and splitter application with a backend in Java SpringBoot and Reactjs in frontend.

- REST API for
    - List of known users (friends).
    - List of transactions.
User can perform CRUD operations in both friends and transactions module.
The transaction is associated with a set of users to split it across.


The poject is still under construction.
I am stuck in login and registration module .Frontend is nearly done.

Though I am learning django nowadays for a project requirement maybe I could try backend of this project  in django. Maybe..


till then....
